The user is prompted to input an operator (one of +, -, *, or /).
Then, two floating-point numbers are requested as input.
The sum of these two numbers is printed using print(num1 + num2).
Next, the code checks the operator:
If it’s “+”, it calculates the sum of num1 and num2 and prints the result rounded to 3 decimal places.
If it’s “-”, it calculates the difference between num1 and num2.
If it’s “*”, it calculates the product of num1 and num2.
If it’s “/”, it calculates the division of num1 by num2.
If the operator is none of the above, it prints an error message.
